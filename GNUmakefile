# This GNUmakefile searches the `sources/` directory for files with an extension of `.xml` and applies `transform.xslt` to them, outputting the result in one of two locations :—
#
# • For files with a location of `sources/index.xml` or `sources/index-*.xml`, the transformed file will be written to `public/%.xml` (where `%` is the filename).
#
# • For all other files with a location of `sources/*.xml` or `sources/*/*.xml`, the transformed file will be written to `public/%/index.xml` (where `%` is the filename and subdirectory if applicable). Only one level of subdirectory is supported.
#
# By default, running `make` will do this for all applicable source files.
